# VerifyIt - Fake Product Detection System

## Overview

Welcome to VerifyIt, the Fake Product Detection System designed to identify counterfeit products and ensure the authenticity of goods. Our solution leverages blockchain technology to create an immutable record of product information, securing the supply chain from manufacturing to distribution. The blockchain ledger ensures that each step is transparent, traceable, and verifiable by stakeholders.

Our platform provides users with a seamless and trustworthy experience, allowing them to easily verify the authenticity of products through QR code scanning or by entering product details.
